  # Set fsGroupPolicy in base manifest and remove via v1.18 patch because:
  #   - kubectl validation will not allow the field in a CSI Driver object applied to a 1.18 cluster (must be removed
  #     via kustomize)
  #   - client-go in the operator has no problem applying a CSI Driver with the field in a 1.18 cluster; it is simply
  #     ignored (safe to keep in base).
