# The following patch makes the BeegfsDriver CRD a "singleton". It was not scaffolded and is not auto-generated. The
# basic idea comes from https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/issues/1074.

# The purpose of this patch is to ensure only ONE BeegfsDriver object can be created. This BeegfsDriver object must be
# named "csi-beegfs-cr". A duplicate object or an object by any other name is rejected by the Kubernetes API server.

# The scaffolded patches all use the strategic merge strategy, but the format of the v1 CustomResourceDefinition does
# not allow for this (a strategic merge patch could only replace the entire spec.versions, but we want to modify
# spec.version[0]).
