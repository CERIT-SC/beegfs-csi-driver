ginkgo -p -focus 'External.Storage' e2e.test -- -storage.testdriver=beegfs-csi-driver/test/basic-driver.yaml -kubeconfig=/home/eric/.kube/config -repo-root=beegfs-csi-driver

Disruptive tests don't seem to play nice with non-disruptive ones. Optionally skip disruptive tests.
	ginkgo -p -focus 'External.Storage' -skip 'Disruptive' e2e.test -- -storage.testdriver=beegfs-csi-driver/test/basic-driver.yaml -kubeconfig=/home/eric/.kube/config -repo-root=beegfs-csi-driver

The -p flag gets us parallel execution. Disruptive tests seem to break on parallel execution. Optionally do not parallelize:
	ginkgo -focus 'External.Storage' e2e.test -- -storage.testdriver=beegfs-csi-driver/test/basic-driver.yaml -kubeconfig=/home/eric/.kube/config -repo-root=beegfs-csi-driver

	Opting not to parallelize makes the tests go SUPER SLOW.

Must have passwordless SSH access to your username on K8s nodes. Your username must have sudo ability.
	There MUST be some way of customizing SSH configuration, but I haven't found it.
	This may only be required for disruptive tests.

	Probably can use some combination of -storage_driver_user and -storage_driver

Best command for running the most tests (so far):
	ginkgo -focus 'External.Storage' e2e.test -- -storage.testdriver=beegfs-csi-driver/test/basic-driver.yaml -kubeconfig=/home/eric/.kube/config -repo-root=beegfs-csi-driver
